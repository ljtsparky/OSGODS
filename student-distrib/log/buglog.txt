## BUG 1

**Expected Result：** Press q on the keyboard, display single q on the screen

**Actual Result：** Press q on the keyboard, display q and a number on the screen

**Explanation；** When press q and loose q, the linux get two signal, so to display q, we have to mask the second signal.

## BUG 2

bug: The screen is static after executing the test_interrupt function but not alternating

solution: Set the frequency of RTC from 1024Hz to 2Hz

## BUG 3

bug: RTC can't get another interrupt after handling one interrupt

solution: Read the RTC status register C at the end of each handler to make sure that RTC can receive other interrupts

## BUG 4
2022 Oct 15 Li jiatong: paging init, when we initialize the page dir entry , there are two different entries to be entered, so we need to treat them differently. 


we solved the bug by setting the page size of the second entry of page dir to be 1 meaning that it corresponds to a 4MB page space, and then make the address of the 4MB space 


which is 0x400000 to right shift 12 because 12 is exactly 4MB, as a result we get 1 to put into the base_address part.


## BUG 5
2022 Oct 15 Li Jiatong: about pic initialization: we found it hard to know whether we initialized those successfully, so used some printf to indicate we finished the init

## BUG 6
2022 Oct 24 Li Jiatong: about keyboard backspace, we used to have the case that backspace won't go back to the remembered position of last line, we solved this by adding a array to remember the last position and when scrolling happened also scroll this array to keep the information correct.

## BUG 7
2022 Oct 24 Li Jiatong: terminal didn't show the terminal writing information because we wrongly made the keyboard index as its input nbytes, however, the keyb index is cleared in the terminal_read, so it is 0 when it goes to write. To solve this , we just used the return value of read to be the input value of write.
## BUG 8
2022 Nov 7 Shen Xing: first we find that our ls command cannot jump to the halt and return to the execute, this is a really hard bug that cost us several hours. Then we find that it is bucause our pid and parent_id wrong, and we set them in the create pcb and the execute, then the functions works quite well.

## BUG 9
2022 NOV 7 Shen Xing: also the bug that happens in halt and execute, when we execute halt, we found that our function jump into a unknown place. So we check the halt function for a while, it is not a difficult bug, and finally we found that we didn't set the current pcb in the halt function.
